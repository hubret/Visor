til: Parser Behaviours (1/2)

con:

-Visor's parser is not whitespace-based, meaning line breaks need to be declared manually by writing + at the start of a line.

-When a slide doesn't have a con attribute, it will automatically make the title large and centered. Otherwise, it'll create a typical

-If any theming attributes are left empty, the default theme will be used.

=8. Parser Behaviours (2/2)

img: #111
col: #fff

til: Parser Behaviours (2/2)

con:

-If attributes like img, sec, or col are left empty after they've been previously declared, future slides will retain the same img, sec, and col, meaning that there's no need to redundantly redescribe each slide.

-The img attribute automatically searches in root folder called images.

-All attributes are optional, not including one (or many) in a slide definition is completely fine.
